I am a Full Stack Developer with a background in Electronic Engineering. Looking for opportunities to continue to accelerate my learning and keep me challenged on a daily basis.

Having come through Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp, I have developed a passion for writing clean, tested and reusable code. I am now a competent and enthusiastic full stack junior developer looking for my first role in an environment where best practices are promoted and I can continue to learn at the pace set whilst at Makers Academy.

## <a name="experience">Experience</a>

**Jaguar Land Rover** (August 2013 to April 2016)
*Advanced Electrical Design Engineer*
Developed new electrical features merging vision technologies from the RADAR and camera systems on the car. Developed features include Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control and Auto High Beam. For the last 6 months I also worked as a Project Manager for the 6 Self Learning Car features, responsible for developing the feature concepts and ensuring the project met the engineering and Human-Machine Interface requirements so that it could progress through the 18 Model Year gateways. I managed a team of 3 software engineers and a system lead.

**University of Bristol** (June 2012 to September 2012)
*Research Assistant*
I completed an 8 week paid summer research project in the networks lab at the University of Bristol, looking at the performance of wireless networks and under what specific traffic conditions the performance drops significantly below the maximum achievable bandwidth.

**Norquay Ski School, Banff Canada** (November 2008 to May 2009)
*Ski Instructor*
I qualified as a Level 2 CSIA certified Ski Instructor and taught for 6 months at Norquay Ski resort in Banff, Canada. I also worked for 2 months as part of the Ski Patrol, where I responded to radio calls, organised the ski patrols response in emergencies and attended the emergencies myself.
