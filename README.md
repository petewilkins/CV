## Pete Wilkins

I am a student at Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp. I previously graduated from the University of Bristol with a masters in Electronic and Communications Engineering. Between graduating and now, I have spent 3 years working in the automotive industry as an Electronic Design Engineer. I have always had an interest in software development and recently decided I wanted to make the move and change careers.

## Experience

**Jaguar Land Rover** (August 2013 to April 2016)    
*Advanced Electrical Design Engineer*  
Developed new electrical features merging vision technologies from the RADAR and camera systems on the car. Developed features include Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control and Auto High Beam. For the last 6 months I also worked as a Project Manager for the 6 Self Learning Car features, responsible for developing the feature concepts and ensuring the project met the engineering and Human-Machine Interface requirements so that it could progress through the 18 Model Year gateways. I managed a team of 3 software engineers and a system lead.

**University of Bristol** (June 2012 to September 2012)   
*Research Assistant*  
I completed an 8 week paid summer research project in the networks lab at the University of Bristol, looking at the performance of wireless networks and under what specific traffic conditions the performance drops significantly below the maximum achievable bandwidth.

**Norquay Ski School, Banff Canada** (November 2008 to May 2009)   
*Ski Instructor*  
I qualified as a Level 2 CSIA certified Ski Instructor and taught for 6 months at Norquay Ski resort in Banff, Canada. I also worked for 2 months as part of the Ski Patrol, where I responded to radio calls, organised the ski patrols response in emergencies and attended the emergencies myself.

## Hobbies and Interests
- **Music** : Writing, playing or watching live, I love it all. I've achieved a musical Grade 8 on Guitar and Grade 6 on Drums.
- **Football** : Unfortunately a Manchester United fan. Ex-Captain of Bristol Badock Hall 1st XI and Cheadle Hulme School 1st XI football teams.
- **Skiing** : Obsessed, hence the gap year!
- **YouTube** : I run a [YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/c/GamingCareers) all about how to livestream, record video and audio, and edit footage professionally.
